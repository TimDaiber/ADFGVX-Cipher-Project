Hello this is the readme file of my project. (Tim Daiber)
What the program does:
1.	Asks user for a password.(Password can be as long as you want and can contain any characters or symbols)
2.	Asks user what file they want to encrypt
3.	Creates Matrix depending on password length (ArrayLists of ArrayLists)
4.	Reads in the file char by char 
a.	Encrypts letters
b.	Adds encrypted letters to the matrix
5.	Sorts matrix in alphabetical of the password (I am using java 1.8 it is needed in my code to sort the matrix)
6.	Creates file and writes encrypted and sorted matrix to file
7.	Resorts the matrix to its original order.
8.	Decrypts the file and adds it to an arraylist of strings
9.	Writes decrypted arraylist to file.(file called finished.txt is  back to readable text)

I have not split my program into classes since it was running slower when I did.

How to run it:
•	Enter password
•	Enter file name you want to encrypt
o	 WarAndPeace-LeoTolstoy.txt)
o	PoblachtNaHEireann.txt
o	DeBelloGallico.txt

Running times:
 Total running time of:
•	WarAndPeace-LeoTolstoy.txt – 0.881 seconds
•	PoblachtNaHEireann.txt – 0.102 seconds
•	DeBelloGallico.txt – 0.458 seconds
